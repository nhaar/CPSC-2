2. Extract the folder

3. Open inside `WaddleForeverClient.exe`. You will likely be warned by computer/antivirus, but you can accept everything as there is no risk in using this program.

4. Enjoy!

> [!WARNING]
> You can only have one client open at a time

# Logging In

You don't create accounts, all you need to do is to login with the name you want. You can use any password, it will always work.

# How to play in Browser or Flash Projector

Instead of using the built-in client, you can play in browser or flash projector if that is better for you.

1. In the Waddle Forever folder, there is a file called `WaddleForeverServer.exe`. Open it and a command prompt will show up. This means the game is running.

2. For browser, go to `http://localhost/` to play. For Flash Projector, go to `http://localhost/boots.swf`.

# All Mission speedrun shortcuts

Two commands you should use for speedruns:

!epf - Teleports to the VR Room, where you can play the game (Currently, you can't become an EPF agent normally)

!awards - Gives you half the awards, so you can play it optimally

# Settings

Currently, the only way to edit settings is to do it manually. In future updates, you will be able to do this from inside the client.

After you play the game once, a file called `settings.toml` will appear. You can open the file and change the settings. Currently, two settings are available:

- `30fps`, set to `true` if you want to play in 30 FPS.
- `thin_ice_igt`, set to `true` to use the Thin Ice IGT mod.

> [!WARNING]
> The Thin Ice IGT mod only works for 30 FPS.

You will need to restart the client or server everytime you make a settings change.

> [!WARNING]
> Making changes in Flash Player requires you to clear cache. In the client you can do that easily in the menu, and it's usually easy for browsers too.
> Clearing cache for Flash Projector is harder as you need a special script for it.

# Data

You can change your database in the folder `data`.

> [!WARNING]
> Since we are still in Beta, the database of newer versions may NOT be consistent with older versions. If you really wish to port an older database, contact us!
